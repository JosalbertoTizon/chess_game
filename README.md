# chess_game
simple gui for a chess game, you can play by moving the pieces by dragging them with the mouse. it restricts you to making valid movements according to the rules of chess and automatically ends the game if game over conditions are met (like checkmate or stalemate)

# limitations
en passant, castling and promotion not implemented yet. The way the code avaliates the validity of a movement, as well as tests for check, checkmate or stalemate, has to be reformulated to easily handle those more complex piece movements.
